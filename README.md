# Lume

Welcome to Lume, a digital storytelling platform by the Minneapolis Institute of Art.

## Running Lume Locally

If you're interested in contributing to Lume (or you just want to try it out on your own machine), you can follow these directions to get the application running on your local machine.

Right now, you'll need a Mac to run the application but I'd welcome a pull request from a Windows user with directions about how to get started.

1. Clone this repository

2. Install Mysql

3. Create and configure a local database

4. Edit the `.env.TEMPLATE` file
