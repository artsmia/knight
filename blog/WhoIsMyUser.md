# Who Is My User?

_Carl Peaslee_


Who is my user? This is one of the most important questions to ask when building any application or product.

After all, if you don't know who your user is, how can you be sure you're building a product or service that your user will actually find useful? And how will you know how to create a positive user experience if you don't understand your potential user's needs and abilities?

Thus, "Who is my user?" became the question I kept repeating to myself as I was working (and to my colleagues at every meeting).

As I continued to ask this question, however, it became to clear me that MIA-storytelling, as we'd conceived of it, would be catering to a widely varying audience of users, each of whom would come with different goals, resources, and expectations.

To put this question about users in perspective, let's use an example: the spoon. You might think, Wow, now that's a product with a large, diverse audience. And you'd be right. But actually, even though a spoon's audience is incredibly large and varied, each individual user's needs and expectations are actually almost exactly the same: they want to pick up food and get it into their mouth without spilling. Relatively straight forward.

However, when we consider MIA-storytelling more closely, we are effectively building multiple products. There is "the client" –– an app meant to run on iPads in galleries to enhance museum goers ability to connect and engage with the art. And then there is also "the cms" –– a content management system intended for museum staff who intend to create content to accompany works of art.

If we take things a step further, we could even say we're building three or four products: not only are we're attempting to make the cms accessible for non-technical users, but we're trying to ensure that it is still powerful and extensible for technically minded users. In keeping with that line of thinking, we could even go so far as to think of the project's open source codebase and documentation themselves as still even another product.

To continue with the spoon metaphor, we're not building just a spoon. We're also building a machine for amateur spoonmakers and advanced spoonmakers to to make spoons as well as an instruction manual so that anyone could build their own custom spoon-maker machine based on ours.

After considering all of this, I tried to sketch out who the users for each of these separate products would be and this is what I ended up with:

_The Museum Goer_
* wants to learn more about a piece of art
* should not need technical ability
* wants an accessible, friendly, entertaining experience

_The Non-Technical Staff Member_
* might be an intern or curator
* wants to create unique content with as little difficulty as possible
* does not want to write code or configure technical details

_The Technical Staff Member_
* is comfortable working with developers to configure customizations and integrate existing systems
* wants to create new kinds of content

_The Developer_
* is comfortable with the codebase, can fork the repository or make pull requests
* wants to modify and launch their own version of the product

Now that we've got a good idea of who are users are, my goal is to make sure we never go more than a week without taking a concerted moment to sit down with a real, potential user and speak with them about the product. What UI elements are confusing? What features are missing?

It can be intimidating to think of the varied users involved with our multiple products but hopefully, if we are diligent in our attempts to understand and serve these stakeholders, we can make our project a success.
