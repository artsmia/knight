# Meet the Team

The Minneapolis Institute of Art (Mia) received a Knight Foundation grant to improve its open-source, digital storytelling platform. Our
goal is to deliver a new version of a tool that is already in use at the museum that we call Art Stories. We’re working on adding more
features, additional flexibility in the formatting of stories, and an improved CMS to ensure these stories are easy to create.

##### So who’s getting it done? 

Mia has three full-time developers: Andrew David, Head of Web Development, Misty Havens, Web Developer, and Kjell Olsen, Web Developer.
This is the team that built Art Stories 1.0. The tool had an original use-case that really drove its design and development. Back in 2013,
Mia re-installed their African art galleries and there was a desire to tell more dynamic and robust stories about the objects themselves.
The tool has since been expanded to 22 iPad locations throughout the museum and almost 100 stories and counting! 

The original platform was built in WordPress and fit the initial needs of the project, but since then, the Dev team has identified room for
improvement. Enter Carl Peaslee. Peaslee was hired on as a contractor to lead the web development part of the project. As most Dev teams
can attest, there’s a lot of work to get done and an extra set of hands helps to keep the ship moving forward. 

Project management is led by Meaghan Tongen, Digital Programs Manager, and Gretchen Halverson, Media and Technology Assistant. In concert
with our fearless leader Douglas Hegley, Chief Digital Officer, we’ve been focused on meeting deadlines, testing early beta versions of the
tool, and ensuring the project stays focused on our primary goals. 

The team is also lucky to have outside insight and support both in and outside Mia. We rely on a dynamic cross-functional team called TDX
(The Digital Experience-- some names are hard to shake). This team includes partners from Curatorial Affairs, Learning Innovation, and
Interactive Media-- partners all focused on ensuring Mia’s digital engagement is cohesive, thoughtful, and, well, engaging! 

As with most successful projects, you want to avoid the echo chamber, so relying on voices outside the museum has been crucial. We’re lucky
enough to have an engaged group of industry experts that make up our advisory group: 
   *Brad Dunn, Web and Digital Communications Director, Field Museum of Chicago
   *Jennifer Foley, Director of Education and Community Engagement, Albright-Knox Art Gallery
   *Jesse Heinzen, Multimedia Director, Minnesota History Center
   *Mike Mouw, Director of Multimedia Technology, The High Museum
   *Koven Smith, Director of Digital Adaptation, Blanton Museum of Art
   *Amanda Thompson Rundahl, Director of Learning and Engagement, Saint Louis Art Museum

We’ve had the chance to connect with the group through video conferencing, an in-person meeting with one advisor, and we look forward to checking in with them at Museum Computer Network 2017 (MCN) in Pittsburgh this November. 

We’re excited about the team we have in place and look forward to learning from one another, finding more partners, and building a really
stellar tool!
