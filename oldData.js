And He said to them, “It is written, my house shall be called a house of prayer; but you are making it a robber’s den.” </em>(Matthew 21:12) His multiple takes on the subject mark his evolving artistic style, each subsequent version being more abstract and stylized.</p>",

Even the most avid armchair Romanologist today might miss what was obvious to Rembrandt’s audience, even with few clues beyond a glinting dagger and a blood-soaked shift: the tragic story of Lucretia. The virtuous wife of a Roman noble killed herself after being raped by the son of Rome’s tyrannical king, and her enraged husband and father launched a rebellion to overthrow the king that resulted in the Roman Republic. This story, recounted by the Roman historian Livy, resurfaced as a morality tale during the Middle Ages and a model of republican values during the Renaissance: a leader must answer to the people he serves.</p>",

            "description": "<p>He had wandered all his life, from the Netherlands to Belgium to Paris, before settling in the south of France in February 1888. Van Gogh came in search of sun, new light to drive his interest in color, and to establish a community of artists. He invited the painter Paul Gauguin to join this “Studio of the South.” Just two months after Gauguin’s arrival, Van Gogh suffered a breakdown. He sliced off part of his own ear, and a terrified Gauguin promptly left, never to return. By May 1889, little more than a year after arriving in the south, Van Gogh had checked himself into Saint-Paul Asylum in Saint-Rémy, where he spent months studying and painting the asylum’s olive groves.</p>",

These two give the painting its title, after the old game in which a blindfolded child stumbles through the darkness to find and “tag” other children. When asked if the couple would ever find each other, the artist Max Beckmann said “Perhaps; let us hope it.”</p>",

He inspired such loyalty among his troops and the citizens of Rome that his adoptive father, the Emperor Tiberius, dispatched him to a distant post in Syria. The general’s mysterious death at 34 fueled suspicions that Tiberius had him poisoned and sparked grief and anger across the Roman Empire. More than 1,500 years later, French painter Nicolas Poussin sought to stir those feelings anew, framed in the stoic restraint of the classical past.</p>",

Francis Bacon painted several portraits of popes (this is number six), and they all appear trapped, isolated and anguished—but beautifully painted. The portraits are based on Diego Velázquez’s celebrated portrait of Pope Innocent X, from 1650. And through his new way of depicting the human figure, Bacon showed what a portrait can be in the 20th century. In each of several studies he made for the painting, Bacon gave the pope a different face. Ultimately, he makes viewers feel as if they were behind the scenes, witnessing a private performance by a public figure.</p>",

Once enshrined in a 10th-century open-air circular temple, this yogini would have sat alongside perhaps 108 other goddesses patiently waiting for devotees to visit. She is one of 19 known sculptures from the same temple that now reside in a dozen museums in America, Europe, and India. The yogini’s monumental size but serene expression emphasize her power of balance, her union of opposites, and would have deeply moved those who prayed to her, perhaps for a cure for illness. </p>",

Henri Matisse was the leader of these artists, who transformed traditional painting by emphasizing the expressive power of color over the realistic depiction of their subject matter. It was the first revolutionary art movement of the 1900s: Fauvism. And although it seemed wild, even brutish, Matisse was aiming for balance, purity, serenity. <em>Three Bathers</em> is from Matisse's immediate post-Fauvist period, when he shifted toward radical simplification and used broad blocks of color to indicate land, water, and sky. Thick contour lines, both pictorial and sculptural, define the bathers and Matisse's struggle to reconcile multiple dimensions with two-dimensional design. </p>",

Zeus was captivated by Ganymede’s beauty, so he disguised himself as an eagle and abducted the boy to serve as the gods’ cup bearer on Mount Olympus. That’s the myth. But Bertel Thorvaldsen’s sculpture suggests a more benign interaction as the boy stoops to offer the eagle a drink and the eagle peacefully leans forward to accept. The eagle’s beak hovers just above the boy’s drink, and the two figures—the human and the divine—are frozen mere seconds before touching. An unnerving love story is reconsidered, revising the relationship between gods and humankind.  </p>",

A gifted landscape artist, Jean-François Millet evokes the boundless space of the rural plains where he lived by squeezing into this space a flock of grazing sheep, a lone shepherd, a man driving a farm cart, and a row of thatched-roof houses among the lush green pastures. He began his professional career in Paris, exhibiting controversial large-scale paintings of peasants at the Salons. Later Millet moved his growing family to the small village of Barbizon joining an informal colony of artists drawn to the forest of Fontainebleau and its bucolic surroundings.</p>",

Chuck Close transformed an 8x10-inch photograph of his friend, Frank James, into a painting by dividing the photo into a grid and copying each section onto the canvas on a much larger scale. He used only two tablespoons of diluted paint to cover the entire canvas, abandoning traditional brushes in favor of airbrushes, sponges, his fingers, razors, even an eraser fastened to an electric drill. The realistic finish, blemishes included, make Frank one detailed dude.</p>",

Girodet painted her portrait, but she found his first effort unflattering and offered just half his asking price. Enraged, Girodet got revenge with this second, satirical version, complete with symbolic details that scathingly hint at her true character.</p>",

At more than two feet tall, made of silver, red marble, and lapis lazuli—a semi-precious blue stone—it’s one of the most imaginative examples of Italian decorative arts from the 1700s. Silversmith Vincenzo Coaci designed it in 1792 to commemorate a monument made several years earlier, when Pope Pius XV had a recently discovered ancient obelisk moved to the Quirinal Piazza, next to his summer residence. There, it was surrounded by two huge horsemen that had stood in that spot since their creation around 400. Topped with a cross, this rearrangement of ancient artifacts from the pagan past was an expression of papal power and a triumph of engineering.  </p>",

The day you received your drivers’ license, the night you crammed your toes into high heels and wobbled into the world four inches taller—these are typical milestones in the march to womanhood.

Elder women wear them during the initiation of girls into womanhood, when they are instructed in ethics, marriage, childcare, personal finance, and traditional songs and dances. The mask reflects their shared aspirations: the carefully ordered hair, high forehead, downcast eyes, and dark skin are all Mende ideals of feminine beauty.</p>\n",

The pilgrims were eating glass and biting their own arms, among other acts of self-abuse, to draw attention to their religion. Vividly colored and vigorously brushed, Delacroix’s masterpiece captured the commotion, even though it was painted from memory five years later—a memory not easily forgotten.</p>",

This salon was his party room. Its chic style and opulent materials showed that Jean Gaillard could afford to play as hard as he worked. Here, he and his guests enjoyed music and other diversions at a time when leisure—how, when, and whom you entertained—said everything about you. </p><p>The decorative carvings of the hunt, musical instruments, and personified continents perfectly conveyed his refined interests and his privileged position within the French government. The luxurious gold-covered plaster and carved wood, crystal, and mirrors reflected not only his wealth but also the candles in the room, amplifying the light so that his parties could carry on late into the night. </p>",

Horses were only affordable, in other words, to those who could command resources and labor from others, and became an important accessory of power for rulers of the ancient West African kingdom of Mali. In fact, the Mali Empire, one of the largest and most powerful states in West Africa during the 1300s, owed much of its military advantage to its horses.</p>",

His teachings formed the basis of Buddhism, and as he lay dying— on a couch in the Himalayan foothills— a golden light emanated from his face. It reached every corner of the world, calling even his most far-flung followers to his deathbed. Sakyamuni had instructed his followers not to grieve his death. He had, after all, achieved the state of Nirvana during his life on earth; in dying, he would be freed from the endless cycle of rebirth and suffering. He would attain Parinirvana, a state of perfect bliss with no death and no earthly body. </p>",

According to Shinto belief, the first deity honored at Kasuga Shrine flew there on the back of a white deer, a transportation option reserved for gods. The shrine was built in 768 by the powerful Fujiwara family on the plains below Mount Mikasa, near Nara. The mountain appears here in the distance, while clouds suggesting the divine deer’s heavenly origin swirl around its feet and a golden disc rests atop it within a sacred tree. This painting is a mandala, a symbol of the universe derived from Hindu and Buddhist traditions.</p>",

Fuji: it’s famous, having given its name to Fujifilm, Fuji Bicycles, Fujitsu, Fuji Heavy Industries (Subaru’s parent company), etc. Mt. Fuji, actually an active volcano, is part of the national soul, and always has been. In 2010, nearly 321,000 people climbed its summit—a record—and in 2013 it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. The artist Hokusai, like many artists before and since, made Mt. Fuji the subject of his work, the wood block print series <em>36 Views of Mt Fuji</em>. <em>Red Fuji</em>, one of Hokusai’s most iconic works, shows Japan’s highest mountain from the Lake Kawaguchi area. </p>",

            "description": "<p>The ancient Romans were supposedly logical, orderly, restrained. When European tastemakers around 1750 translated their ideas of ancient Rome into a design style they called Neoclassical—literally “new classical”—they focused on symmetry, balance, and straight geometric lines. But Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720–78), a well-known Italian printmaker, envisioned the Roman world more like a party. Riffing on Neoclassical motifs, he bent the lines into curvaceous flamboyance, like the over-the-top Rococo style that had charmed Europe a few decades earlier. An artist should be able to blend inspiration from various times and places, he argued, which is exactly what he did with this top pier table, usually set against a wall and often beneath a mirror.</p>",

Monet found the answers, painting the same familiar scene near his home in Giverny in all seasons, at all hours, in all kinds of weather. A grainstack sits broadly in a field, the edges of its silhouette glowing as the sun climbs amid a cool mist to illuminate the landscape. Orange, yellow, green, and violet dance across the field as the earth meets the sky in a hazy blur. For Monet, this light was just as much the subject of his work as the grainstack itself.</p>",

The wallpaper was donated to Mia by Mabel and Wayne H. MacFarlane, and usually recedes into the background, behind furniture also given by the MacFarlane family and set up in this room in the 1970s. The furniture has been removed to highlight the story playing out on the walls.</p><p> </p>",

These 16 sliding screens depicting rice farming form a continuous agricultural panorama and were likely painted by Kanō Sanraku, who decorated other rooms in the temple around 1620. In 1755, they were given to the artist Ōoka Shunboku (1680–1763) in exchange for additional decorating work at the temple and were later combined into four four-panel screens. After Mia acquired them in 1980, they were restored to their original format as sliding screens.</p>",

In the shape of a spire, the <i>mihrāb</i> literally points to the heavens. The <i>mihrāb</i> is also built into the wall that directly faces Mecca, the Saudi Arabian city of Mohammad’s birth and the site of the yearly <i>hajj </i>pilgrimage. During prayer, Muslims around the world face Mecca, which is easily done in a mosque: simply face the <i>mihrāb</i>. As a reminder to face Mecca, the shape of a <i>mihrāb </i>is often woven into prayer mats.</p>\n",

Each square of this quilt top was likely purchased separately, in kits sold for a penny, and had to be sewn together. That said, the quirky mix of designs—exhibition pavilions, historical/political figures, children, birds, plants, sayings—were probably pre-printed on the fabric. All the embroiderer had to do was follow the lines.</p>",

And they pulled the scenes and characters straight out of the caustic but hilarious political cartoons published in the most Northern-leaning newspapers.</p>",

The middle is the meat, made of batting—the fluffy stuff that gives a quilt its heft. The thicker the batting, the warmer you'll be underneath it. (In the past, the middle consisted of another layer of fabric, or even paper.) Then there's the backing, usually less decorative than the top. The final step: quilting stitches, which add another subtle element of design and join all three layers together. </p>",

When creating her kitchen design, Austrian architect Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky turned to unlikely sources for inspiration: railway cars and passenger ships.  Her kitchen, later dubbed the Frankfurt Kitchen, was efficient, compact, clean . . . and equally important, could be mass-produced: it was installed in about 10,000 new apartments.  Look out the large window for a view of the new post-WWI housing complex in which this kitchen was originally placed. </p>",

Capable of 100 miles per hour, it was ideal for the newly opened Autobahn, the German federal highway system, which for the most part has no speed limit.</p>",

He used people he met in Rio’s slums as models, men whose background might cause them to be forgotten just as Santos-Dumont has been left on the runway of history.</p>",

At some point, they were taken apart and shuffled around, making their original order a mystery. We do know they’re more than 400 years old, illustrated with hand-painted Biblical scenes and Ethiopian saints, monks, and worshippers. And that they comprised a kind of devotional prayer book for an Ethiopian Orthodox Christian—so it’s lucky we have these pages at all, given how much they were handled. As for who’s who and what’s what, you’ll need to study your Ge’ez or dive into the subtitled version available here.</p>",

Specialized craftsmen laced together hundreds of lacquered metal and leather plates with red and indigo silk cords to give the suit its distinctive appearance and flexibility. It was tailor-made, likely for a high-ranking official from the Kii Tokugawa family and possibly Tokugawa Yorinobu himself (1602–71), the founder of that family branch. </p>",

The panel reviewing Baer’s cup in 1746 declared his work to be excellent (despite a few microscopic holes in the casting) and he was accepted as a Master of the Echasse Guild, just like his father and brother before him and his son after him.

Sowah Kwei followed in his father’s footsteps, making this coffin in 1993. Coffin shapes are personalized for their eternal occupants, and a lobster would be an appropriate choice for, say, a fisherman. Coffin makers began making two identical coffins, one for local burial and one for the national and especially international art market. Mia’s coffin is of the latter sort.</p>",

But one had a twist: it was tied with an impenetrable web of knots, and men from the groom’s family took turns trying to open it. Failure meant having to dance, sing, or otherwise entertain the bride. The groom was ultimately expected to win, but untying the knot didn’t symbolize the marriage coming apart.

Although she first appeared in West Africa many centuries ago, this particular image of her became popular in southern Nigeria in the early 1900s. This unusually large figure was probably made in the early 1950s—dig the A-line skirt and trendy shoes. Street-wise and fashion-forward, she’ll share the secrets of her success with anyone looking to get a stylish leg up in the modern world and willing to pay her price: gifts and more, sometimes even celibacy.</p>",

The Osage migrated west from the Ohio River valley to present-day Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas, and Oklahoma. And although they came across many imported materials, this never diluted their native aesthetics. Instead, they used these new items to enhance traditional designs and refine their techniques. Friendship blankets, as the name suggests, embody affection and connection, and are made as gifts. During a dance, the red hands gently sway back and forth—symbols of friendship. </p>",

In the 1700s, they were losing people to the trans-Atlantic slave trade even as a civil war tore them apart. A Kongolese noblewoman, Beatriz Kimpa Vita, began a movement declaring St. Anthony the savior of the kingdom. But Toni Malau did not save Beatriz Kimpa Vita. In 1706, she was captured by a Kongo ruler and burned as a heretic. The movement outlasted her death, however, and this ivory sculpture, carved over 200 years ago, is a testament to her teaching.</p>\n",

As with most folk art, the answer is more complicated than it would appear, divorced from art history trends and almost inscrutably personal. William Howard worked at Kirkwood Plantation in Mississippi as a freed man after the Civil War, where he was likely inspired by the furniture. The symmetry and structure of his desk echo the Federal style, popular two generations earlier, that was inspired by classical Greek and Roman art. By taking an ornamental approach to these unassuming utensils, as only he thought to do, he turned his desk into a masterpiece of American folk art.</p><p> </p>",

When the photograph did appear, in the December 26, 1960, double issue, “25 Years of LIFE,” it was featured as one of the magazine’s top 100 photographs. Fifteen years after the fact, it was time for a more hopeful image of the past: the survivors. </p>"

Dancers often played clappers, either by hitting them together like modern-day claves or by holding two in their hands like castanets. In fact, clappers were so closely associated with dancing that the hieroglyphic symbol for dance contains a clapper, and the rhythm of the music is embodied in a glyph meaning “palpitation of the heart.”</p>\n",

Despite his vast dominion, Maximilian was chronically short of cash and could not afford major architectural monuments preserving his memory. What he did have was vision—he understood the power of mass media and the influence that a print equivalent could have when sent throughout his far-flung territories. Mia's version of the <em>Triumphal Arch</em>, from the 1700s, serves as a paper monument to him. </p>",

He has the body to back it up—six heads, arms, and legs—and a great ride: a water buffalo bull. Looks real enough, too, especially the bull—wood sculptures in the Kamakura period were known for their remarkable realism. In the Buddhist pantheon, the Wisdom King is a god to reckon with, one of the wrathful, ferocious Myōō deities whose mythical knowledge can help overcome earthly passions. These gods came from India along with Esoteric Buddhism (Daiitoku being derived from the Hindu death god Yamantaka), though it’s not known in which temple this Daiitoku was originally housed. </p>",

Written in the 1000s by the court lady Murasaki Shikibu (c. 973–c. 1014 or 1025), it chronicles the fictional Prince Genji and his descendants, focusing on the aristocratic life and spirit of the times. It has inspired many adaptations through the centuries and remains an important part of Japanese culture today. This pair of screens is ordered around the four seasons depicting scenes from ten different chapters based on what season they occurred in, versus when in the story they chronologically happened.  This pair of screens is one of the best examples of <em>The Tale of Genji</em> screens in the US for its use of gold, pigments, heavy detail, and its pristine condition. </p><p> </p>",

Their shape and scale are unusual for porcelain work—it’s difficult to create large objects from the dense material. They do not appear to made by human hands. They demand reverence and distance, as though they were never touched and remain&nbsp;untouchable. They differ significantly in this respect from the traditional Japanese approach to ceramics, in which exploring and feeling the texture with one’s own hands is an important aspect of appreciation. And yet the aloof aura of a Fukami sculpture does not completely overcome such a desire.</p>",

The answer is usually uninspired: dreary, hard-to-watch images that don’t tell us anything new about suffering.  Kentridge was more original. His animated video is an unusual, diary-like take on race relations during apartheid, the South African system of racial segregation that was the law of the land from 1948 to 1994. It is serious and meditative, yet engaging and hopeful. As a cartoon character, he makes, erases, and remakes drawings within an old how-to book to emphasize that there are no formulas, only change. The book’s pages turn, like the movement of time, to mournful music by South African composer Neo Muyanga.</p>",

Before air conditioning, residents were drawn to the natural cooling of the Kamo River. Restaurants installed wooden platforms over the water for outdoor dining with all the usual indoor entertainment.</p><p>This is an everyday scene, but not an everyday painting. Utagawa Toyohiro typically focused on a few figures or a landscape in his paintings, but here presents a richer narrative driven by multiple dynamic interactions. Toyohiro made relatively few paintings and used woodblock printing to make them more available and affordable for the masses.</p>",

Decades of busy trade and cultural exchange followed, but within a hundred years the party was over. Japan's leaders adopted a seclusionist stance in the 1620s and '30s, and the country entered more than two hundred years of <em>sakoku </em>(literally, \"closed country\"). Travel to and from Japan was prohibited, but pictures and other information continued to trickle in, providing the Japanese with glimpses of the outside world. One such window into the world is this handheld scroll from 1649, showing people from forty different countries.

John Bradstreet, who designed the room, perfected the aging and carving of cypress wood in his Minneapolis interior design company around 1900, based on a technique he learned in Japan. This unique woodwork, combined with fireplace tiles and light fixtures by Tiffany Studios and matching textiles, fill the homey historic interior with rich color and texture. The look went out of style around 1915, but Mrs. Prindle never redecorated, making this an interior that can’t be seen anywhere else.</p>",

I could add, perhaps, that Max also called his figures in the center panel “the gods” in contrast to the people on the side panels engaged in worldly activities and interests, except the two opposite figures, the kneeling woman and the blindfolded man—both seeking their destiny, will [sic] say in this case, finding each other. Will they? Max said: “Perhaps—let us hope it.” But do they know each other? “Of course not. Not yet.” The side panels are meant as the worldly enjoyments, activities and behaviors of those people, who look only for the satisfaction of their sense-organs, (again except of the two I have mentioned before.) The center panel represents the Art; music, music in itself as well performed, Art (every Art) as a gift of God and also Art as one of His manifold expressions. Therefore he called those figures “the gods.” What Perry said is also true and Max agreed. The passion of the man with the horsehead mask for the beauty in her ermine cape—a variation of Jupiter and Venus.</em></p><p><em>I think that is about all, maybe you knew all that anyway?</em></p><p><em>Meanwhile best wishes and regards to both of you,</em></p><p><em>Cordially, Quappi</em></p>",

His earliest work reflected his traditionalist training and is very un-Matisse. During the late 1890s, Paris’ art scene was active and dynamic and soon Matisse was experimenting with the diverse styles of the time including Impressionism and Neo-Impressionism.</p>",

When their pictures were exhibited later that year in Paris, a witty critic called the works <em>fauves</em>, or \"wild beasts\" in his review, because the works were so striking compared with traditional French art of the time. The term stuck, and was later applied to the artists themselves.</p>",

This created spaces between the warps and facilitated the passing of the weft thread, freeing up both hands for weaving, and speeding up production. In this method, large strips of the cartoon were often cut up and inserted directly onto the loom frame, behind the warp threads, so the weaver looked not at a reflection but directly at the cartoon.</p>",

The fineness of the yarns impacted visual quality, rate of production, and ultimately price: tapestries with a higher number of threads per square inch demanded much higher prices. This tapestry includes silk yarns and has a high thread count, indicating it is very high quality. It probably took five weavers almost nine months to make.</p>",
